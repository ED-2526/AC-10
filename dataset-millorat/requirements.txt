This is the requirements.txt file for the dataset-cris project. 
It lists all the necessary Python packages needed to run the project.

If you need to install these packages, you can do so by running:
pip install -r requirements.txt or install them by executing data_prep.py script.


If we need more packages in the future, we can simply add them to this file !!!! :)
